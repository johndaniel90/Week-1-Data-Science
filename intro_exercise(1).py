# pandas is a common library for working with data in Python, we usually import it like so:
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# This data comes from the UCI ML repository:
# https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset
# It is the daily number of users from a bike share program
df = pd.read_csv('day.csv')

# shows a preview of the data
df.head()
# shows some basic stats of the data
df.describe()

# Use the examples in the jupyter notebook to help you here.
